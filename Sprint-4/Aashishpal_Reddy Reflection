During Sprint 4,
I focused on expanding the Habit Challenge App with a deeper layer of interaction and personalization.
The primary goal of this sprint was to enhance both engagement and progress tracking by introducing games 
that use user input for tailored feedback, as well as connecting game results to the leaderboard.

Major Accomplishments

WordScramblerGame
I developed the WordScramblerGame, word puzzle that challenges users to unscramble habit-related terms and missing letters. 
It sharpens recall and reinforces healthy habit vocabulary in a fun and gamified format. 
Each correctly unscrambled word contributes to the XP system, motivating users to think quickly and stay engaged. 
It even gives the meaning of the word so the user will be gaining knowledge if they doesn't know about that particular habit.

FitnessAssessment Feature
I implemented a full FitnessAssessment module where users enter their height and weight, and based on the data, 
they receive categorized suggestions (e.g., Fit, Diet, Normal). From there, they are provided with customized workout and nutrition plans. 
This personalized feedback mechanism boosts the practical utility of the app and aligns perfectly with HabitQuest mission of driving real-life wellness through habit-building.

XP-to-Leaderboard Integration
A significant task completed this sprint was connecting game results directly to the leaderboard shown in the dashboard. 
Now, when a game is completed, the awarded XP is reflected immediately in the leaderboard component in Dashboard, creating a sense of accomplishment and real-time competition among users.

My Learnings
This sprint deepened my understanding of data-driven feature design. Working on the FitnessAssessment taught me how to take user metrics 
and convert them into conditional logic and UI outcomes. I also gained hands-on experience in React context usage by connecting game XP updates to leaderboard. 
Additionally, building the WordScramblerGame improved my knowledge of string manipulation, timers, and real-time feedback rendering in React.

Challenges Faced
One key challenge was designing the logic to accurately interpret fitness data and give meaningful and motivating recommendations. 
Balancing realism and simplicity in fitness suggestions required careful conditional structuring. 
Another challenge was ensuring XP updates were synced properly across all relevant components (especially when switching between tabs or returning to the dashboard). 
Debugging and syncing React context across multiple components required careful state management.

Areas for Improvement
Moving forward, I aim to enhance the design of the FitnessAssessment UI to make the results more visually engaging and easier to interpret. 
I also plan the games developed by me increase excitement to the users and allow them to earn more XP  and learn about the new habits which they does not have idea.
