The objective for Sprint 4 was to improve user customisation and simplify interaction by creating intelligent, data-driven features that improve the HabitQuest experience. I focused on improving the daily check-in popup to assess a user's previous activity and recommend relevant actions based on that behavior. For example, if a person was actively playing chess the week before, the algorithm would urge that they continue that behavior. This feature increases habit continuity and makes the software more responsive to user needs.

In addition, I created a dynamic profile popup that displays the user's submitted photo as an interactive icon in the upper-right corner. When you click this button, a customizable menu with account-related settings appears, and the component allows for real-time image modifications.This feature was meant to work seamlessly across all user accounts, resulting in a more consistent and professional user interface.

I also helped Ronit with development, as he was creating a new popup feature that had some execution concerns at first. I worked with him to debug the component and test multiple render states. To avoid interfering with the main branch, I continued feature work on my personal branch, PReddy. This enabled me to frequently push changes, test features, and iterate without interrupting the overall program.

My further efforts included finishing the navigation bar functionality, which now allows users to easily move to the dashboard or refresh the page by clicking the logo.I also applied and tested the logout and profile dropdown menu system, which is now fully implemented and adds to the usability of the app. They not only enhance the visual design but also improve interaction efficiency.

In this sprint, I struggled with issues related to rendering lag and changing between branches, especially with asynchronous state and data. Despite these setbacks, I maintained a stable testing environment and learned valuable skills in real-time UI development, backend support, and team-based problem-solving. Sprint 4 helped finalize key parts of our app and prepared us for optimizations and scaling in the next development phase
