Sprint Reflection

Over the course of the most recent sprint, I played a key role in ensuring that our habit tracker application's backend was deployed successfully to Vercel. One of my major accomplishments was troubleshooting and resolving several deployment errors related to our Express.js setup. I carefully reviewed the codebase, identified compatibility issues with ES modules and Vercel’s serverless function architecture, and helped restructure the project for a clean deployment.

My individual contributions also included converting several CommonJS-based controllers to ES Module and improving error handling and logging across the API routes. Additionally, I collaborated closely with Diego and Ronit in setting up the MongoDB connection caching strategy and organizing route handlers for tasks, habits, user auth, and local storage.

One of the biggest challenges I encountered was figuring out why our backend endpoints were not connecting after deployment. At first, it was unclear whether the issue was related to MongoDB configuration, Vercel’s serverless environment, or the way we were exporting our app. Through trial and error and deep dives into Vercel’s documentation, I learned how to properly structure and export the Express app to ensure it worked as a serverless function. This was a valuable learning experience that boosted my confidence in deploying real-world applications.

Through this sprint, I learned a lot about backend deployment, Vercel’s limitations, and the importance of using consistent module systems across files. I also gained hands-on experience managing environment variables securely and improved my debugging skills by logging and tracing deployment errors.

Looking ahead, one area of improvement would be better initial planning of the file structure and module format (CommonJS vs ESM). Our team could also benefit from more frequent commits and pull requests during the sprint, which would make it easier to track progress and avoid merge conflicts. I personally aim to improve my Git workflow and communication during coding sessions to make collaboration even smoother.

Overall, this sprint helped me grow as a backend developer, and I’m proud of the progress our team made together.
