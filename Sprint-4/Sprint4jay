# Sprint Reflection

Over the past sprint, I've been heavily involved in various aspects of our project development, primarily focusing on improving the user interface and resolving technical issues that arose during our collaborative work.

## What I Accomplished

My main contributions centered around enhancing the user experience across multiple pages of our application. I resolved several merge conflicts that occurred when team members were working simultaneously on overlapping code sections. This was critical in maintaining our development momentum and ensuring code integrity. I also made significant improvements to the login page, adding new components, styling techniques, and descriptive elements to make it more intuitive and user-friendly.

Another key contribution was updating the homepage with glassmorphism effects, which gave our application a more modern and polished look. Additionally, I improved the dashboard page by implementing a white space concept that makes the interface appear more premium and professional. Navigation between tabs was streamlined, and I added emoji elements to make the interface more engaging.

Perhaps most importantly, I developed a new habit creation page with comprehensive features including habit type selection, frequency options, description fields, and a preview section to improve user engagement.

## Challenges I Encountered

The main challenge I faced was managing code conflicts. With multiple team members working concurrently, we experienced frequent merge conflicts that required careful resolution to avoid losing important changes. These situations demanded good communication with team members and a thorough understanding of the codebase to properly integrate everyone's work.

Another significant challenge was optimizing the dashboard performance. As noted in one of my commits, the dashboard became "a bit heavy" due to the accumulation of components. This required troubleshooting and refactoring to maintain responsiveness.

## What I Learned

This sprint deepened my understanding of Git workflow, particularly in handling complex merge scenarios. I also expanded my frontend development skills, learning how to implement glassmorphism effects and more effective use of white space in UI design.

Working with the team taught me valuable lessons about code organization and the importance of documentation. As evidenced by my commit updating documentation for the dashboard page, I recognized how crucial clear documentation is for team understanding and future maintenance.

## What Could Be Improved

For the next sprint, I should focus on making my commit messages more descriptive and consistent. Some of my messages were quite brief and didn't fully capture the extent of the changes made. Additionally, I could improve my planning to reduce the frequency of merge conflicts by better coordinating with team members before starting work on shared components.

From a team perspective, we should establish clearer coding standards and more regular code reviews to catch issues earlier. The dashboard performance issues might have been prevented with earlier optimization considerations.
