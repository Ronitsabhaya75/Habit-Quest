Updated Sprint 5 Summary
During Sprint 5, I focused on modernizing the application architecture, improving backend stability, expanding features, and enhancing the overall deployment strategy. Key updates include transitioning from a Node.js backend to a full-stack Next.js application, redeploying the platform on Vercel, refining MongoDB models and APIs, and introducing a background music feature to elevate user experience.

Key Accomplishments
Migration to Next.js
Successfully transitioned the codebase from a traditional Node.js/Express setup to a full-stack Next.js architecture.

Simplified API routing and improved frontend-backend integration, resulting in faster load times and a more maintainable project structure.

Deployment on Vercel
Deployed the updated Next.js application to Vercel, leveraging serverless functions and automatic scaling.

Configured environment variables, database connections, and optimized the build for production deployment.

Backend and MongoDB Model Refinement
Audited and improved the MongoDB models to ensure data consistency, validation, and scalability.

Refactored backend logic to align with the new Next.js API routes, resulting in cleaner and more modular code.

Task API Fixes
Debugged and enhanced the task management API, ensuring accurate CRUD operations and proper task assignment handling.

Improved the reliability of task updates, completion tracking, and integration with the leaderboard and calendar systems.

Background Music Feature
Introduced a background music functionality, allowing users to enjoy a more immersive and engaging app environment.

Developed a toggle option so users can control music playback according to their preference.

Challenges Faced
Migrating the backend while maintaining existing functionalities required careful restructuring and incremental testing.

Managing database operations with new Next.js API routes introduced challenges around session management and API call optimization.

Ensuring smooth music playback across various components without performance degradation required fine-tuned state management.

Lessons Learned
Deepened my knowledge of Next.js architecture, including API routes, server-side rendering, and deployment best practices.

Strengthened skills in MongoDB schema design, data validation, and error handling.

Gained experience integrating multimedia features (background music) in web applications to enhance user experience.

Areas for Improvement
Further optimize serverless function calls on Vercel to minimize cold start times.

Enhance database indexing and query efficiency for faster API responses.

Expand user settings for background music (e.g., volume control, playlist options).

Conclusion
Sprint 5 marked a major technical leap by modernizing the backend, deploying efficiently on Vercel, and enriching the user experience with background music. These changes laid a strong foundation for future scalability, smoother interactions, and a more engaging environment. Moving forward, I plan to continue optimizing backend performance and explore more personalization features for users.
