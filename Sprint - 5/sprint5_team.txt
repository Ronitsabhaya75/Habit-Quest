Sprint 5 Team Documentation
Overview
During Sprint 5, the team focused on major architectural improvements, fixing critical errors, refining the design, and thoroughly testing new and existing features. Our goal was to ensure stability, improve performance, and deliver a cleaner, more scalable application.

Major Updates
1. Backend Migration to Next.js
Migrated backend from Node.js/Express to Next.js API routes.

Updated the project structure to support full-stack Next.js development.

Verified API compatibility and ensured smooth frontend-backend integration.

2. Deployment to Vercel
Successfully deployed the application on Vercel.

Set up environment variables and connected MongoDB for production.

Tested serverless deployment, ensuring all routes and APIs work correctly in the deployed environment.

3. MongoDB Models and Backend Fixes
Reviewed and fixed inconsistencies in MongoDB models (e.g., user, task, leaderboard).

Improved schema validation and added better default values where needed.

Refactored backend logic to match the Next.js API format.

4. Task API Debugging and Enhancement
Identified and resolved issues in task creation, updating, and completion tracking.

Integrated task rewards with leaderboard and calendar synchronization.

Retested all task flows to confirm proper backend operations.

5. Background Music Feature
Added background music functionality for enhanced user engagement.

Created a simple control (play/pause) for user customization.

Integrated the music component without impacting app performance.

Design and Testing Work
Design Refinements
Matched Login and Register pages for consistent UI/UX flow.

Adjusted dashboard, tasks, and leaderboard interfaces for uniformity.

Verified responsiveness across desktop and mobile devices.

Deployment-specific API errors (Vercel cold starts handled).

Key Focus for Next Sprint
Further improve API response times and reduce serverless function latency.

Add user settings for background music (volume control, toggle option).

Polish minor UI glitches on smaller devices.

Continue stress-testing the multiplayer chess game under different network conditions.
